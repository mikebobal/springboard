*Data Set Information:*

2126 fetal cardiotocograms (CTGs) were automatically processed and the
respective diagnostic features measured. The CTGs were also classified
by three expert obstetricians and a consensus classification label
assigned to each of them. Classification was both with respect to a
morphologic pattern (A, B, C. ...) and to a fetal state (N, S, P).
Therefore the dataset can be used either for 10-class or 3-class
experiments.

DP - # of prolongued decelerations per second
ASTV - percentage of time with abnormal short term variability
MSTV - mean value of short term variability
ALTV - percentage of time with abnormal long term variability
MLTV - mean value of long term variability
